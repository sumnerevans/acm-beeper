# Outline

* Problems with existing chat networks

  * Closed source
  * Walled-gardens (you can't send a message to someone on WhatsApp from
    iMessage)
  * Not E2EE*

* What Matrix provides

  * Open protocol specification that is designed specifically to break down
    walled gardens via bridging
  * E2EE by default
  * Decentralized, meaning no one entity controls the Matrix network (similar to
    email)
  * Resilient to bad network connections
  * Bots

* How does it work?

  * C-S API and federation API
  * Event DAG
  * State events
  * Eventual consistency

* Things that I am excited about

  * Obviously excited about bridges
  * Excited about possibilities with bots
  * Excited about possibilities of building on top of Matrix. For example,
    matrix notepad and matrix board
  * Excited about spaces and the potential for better community management

* How can you get involved?

  * Right here:

      * Join the ACM chat!
      * If you are interested in building non-chat applications on top of
        Matrix, consider joining Visplay

  * News/community:

    * Read TWIM
    * Interact with the Element folks in various chat rooms

  * Contribute

    * Contribute bug fixes to Synapse, Element, existing bridges and bots, etc.
    * Write new bridges (Beeper may even pay you, contact Eric)
    * Write bots
    * Consider joining Beeper

* A few tips in general for everyone:

  * Try out lots of stuff until you find something that you are sufficiently
    motivated by

  * If you want to get into open source, then get into open source: start by
    just using open source projects, and reporting issues, submitting
    documentation fixes, and even small code fixes.
