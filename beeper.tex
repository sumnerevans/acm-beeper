\section{Why Matrix?}

\begin{frame}{Let's talk about chat platforms\ldots}
    Which of the following chat networks do you use/have you used?
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        \begin{itemize}[<+->]
            \item SMS/MMS
            \item iMessage
            \item LinkedIn
            \item Snapchat
            \item WhatsApp
            \item Instagram
            \item Discord
            \item Facebook Messenger
            \item Hangouts
            \item Slack
            \item Microsoft Teams
            \item Signal
            \item Telegram
            \item Wire
        \end{itemize}
    \end{multicols}
    \pause[\thebeamerpauses]
    What do all of these chat networks have in common?
    \pause

    They are \textbf{non-interoperable, and many are closed source and/or
    unencrypted}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why is this a problem?}
    The \textbf{closed source} platforms are problematic because you can never
    be sure \textit{how your data is being used}.
    \pause

    The \textbf{unencrypted} platforms are problematic because your messages are
    not private.
    \pause

    And, because none of them are interoperable, you have to have a ton of chat
    apps on your phone.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Imagine if\ldots}
    you could start a chat with anyone in the world, on any chat platform just
    by searching their name?
    \pause

    And further imagine that the chat was totally secure.
    \pause

    And further imagine that you could choose what chat client you wanted to
    use.
\end{frame}

\section{Introducing Matrix}

\begin{frame}{Matrix solves all your problems}
    Matrix is an \textbf{open} specification for \textbf{encrypted},
    \textbf{decentralized} communication. \pause

    It is also designed in such a way that it makes it easy to break down walled
    garden communication platforms via \textbf{bridging}.

    \centering
    \visible<2>{\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{graphics/bridging.png}}
    \tiny
    \url{https://presents.half-shot.uk/slides/!mfikNYyXndTTDgQjAu:half-shot.uk/$F-4FHKkgjcLDJaKvw7C19NJ6BWkrk6n7GeIxK-TcxWg}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A side note}
    I first became interested in Matrix when I was the incoming Chair of ACM.
    Robby (VC) and I tried out most of the open source chat platforms and ended
    up landing on Matrix because it had all of these characteristics.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Matrix is an \textit{open specification}}
    Open specifications and standards are all around you. They just make
    sense\texttrademark.

    Examples:\pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Power plugs
        \item USB
        \item Wi-Fi
        \item Every crypto algorithm that's any good
    \end{itemize}
    \pause

    Open protocols allow for \textit{open development} and  \textit{clean-room
    implementations}, they \textit{encourage competition}, and are
    \textit{externally auditable}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Matrix is \textit{encrypted} by default*}
    Matrix has encryption built-in.

    The core of the encryption is \textbf{Olm}, which is a clone of the Signal
    double-ratchet protocol.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If a single key is compromised, the attacker cannot see past
            messages. This is called \textbf{forward secrecy}.
        \item Key exchanges happen often, and if an attacker misses a single key
            exchange, they are once again locked out. This is called
            \textbf{break-in recovery}.
    \end{itemize}
    \pause

    You end up with 1:1 Olm ratchets between all participants in the room.
    \pause

    Those ratchets are used to share the key data for the group ratchet (called
    Megolm) which is used to encrypt messages.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Matrix is \textit{decentralized}}
    The Matrix architecture is actually a \textit{federated} architecture.

    Individual devices communicate to a \textit{homeserver} which anyone can
    host.

    The homeserver communicates with other homeservers in the federation.
    \pause

    Think of it like email. You can email somebody using Outlook from Gmail.*
    \pause

    Every server in the federation gets a copy of a room, so no one entity
    controls the network.
    \pause

    This also means that the network is resilient to censorship, individual
    server outages, or even wider internet outages.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Matrix allows for \textit{bridges} and \textit{bots}}
    Bridges bring external chat networks into Matrix. More on this in a moment.
    \pause

    Bots allow for automated interactions and notifications.
\end{frame}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How is this better than self-hosting?}
    \textbf{Convenience!}
    \pause

    We do all of the heavy lifting and managing the bridges so you don't have
    to.

    You basically pay us to keep your bridges running and up-to-date.
    \pause

    We also maintain Synapse, so you don't have to.
    \pause

    And to top it all off, we have awesome clients!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Beeper clients}
    \Huge
    \textbf{Demo}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What do I do at Beeper?}
    I work on the bridge team creating bridges to new networks and fixing issues
    with existing bridges.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item I built the LinkedIn bridge.
        \item I added a couple small features to the Slack bridge.
        \item I am currently working on improving the reliability of the Signal
            bridge.
    \end{itemize}
    \pause

    I also like writing bots.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item I wrote a standup bot for our asynchronous standup posts.
        \item I'm currently writing a Chatwoot bot for helping our support team
            manage support requests.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{How does Matrix work?}

\begin{frame}{Architecture}
    Every server has a copy of the room, but how do we keep that in sync?
    \pause

    The architecture of Matrix does this in a way that ensures \textit{eventual
    consistency}.
    \pause

    Even if the server where the room was created goes down, people can still
    communicate.

    When a broken server comes back online, it will receive all the
    \textit{events} (messages).
    \pause

    Let's look at the animation on Matrix.org\ldots
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Client-Server API}
    The \textbf{Client-Server API} specifies how clients communicate with their
    homeserver.

\begin{frame}{Federation (Server-Server) API}

    servers communicate with other servers to ensure that everyone has the same
    room state.

            \item A \textbf{directed graph} is a graph where the edges are
                \textit{directional} (have arrows).
            \item An \textbf{acyclic graph} is a graph that has no cycles/loops.
            \item A \textbf{directed acyclic graph (DAG)} is a directional graph
                with no cycles.

            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/dag}
        }
    \end{column}
    \end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The event DAG}
    Matrix rooms are represented by a DAG of \textit{events} representing things
    such as messages, joins, leaves, etc.
    \pause

    The DAG provides a \textit{partial ordering} of events in the room because
    every event has zero or more ``parent'' events.
    \pause

    This is similar to Git where every commit has 0 or more ``parent'' commits.

    \vspace{1cm}
    {
        \tiny
        See \url{https://matrix.org/docs/spec/\#event-graphs}
    }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Event types}
    There are two main event types: \textbf{message events} and \textbf{state
    events}.
    \pause

    \textbf{Message events:} \\
    These describe transient `once-off' activity in a room such as an instant
    messages, VoIP call setups, file transfers, etc. They generally describe
    communication activity.
    \pause

    \textbf{State events:} \\
    These describe updates to a given piece of persistent information (`state')
    related to a room, such as the room's name, topic, membership, participating
    servers, etc. State is modelled as a lookup table of key/value pairs per
    room, with each key being a tuple of \texttt{state\_key} and \texttt{event
    type}. Each state event updates the value of a given key.

\section{Things that I'm excited about in Matrix}

\begin{frame}{Bridges}
    I work on the bridge team at Beeper, so I am obviously excited about the
    possibilities there.
    \pause

    I hope that in the future, it will be a no-brainer to base all new chat
    applications on top of Matrix.

    I also hope that existing chat networks rebase on Matrix, so bridges become
    unnecessary.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Bots}
    I'm excited about the possibilities for more interactivity bots.
    \pause

    Right now, basically only IRC-style text-based communication is possible
    with bots.

    There are MSCs for things like buttons, suggested replies, etc. which will
    really make bots more featureful.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Non-chat applications}
    Many people are experimenting with trying to use Matrix for things other
    than chat.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Social media (Cerulean and Circles)
        \item Blogs
        \item Comment systems for blogs
        \item Collaborative notepads
        \item Collaborative whiteboards
    \end{itemize}

    All of these applications take advantage of the fact that at the end of the
    day, Matrix is just a distributed DAG.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Client features}
    I'm excited about a bunch of features that are coming soon\texttrademark\ 
    including:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Spaces and the many features that it will bring that will help
            facilitate community management
        \item Threads
        \item Extensible profiles (profiles as rooms)
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{How to get involved with Matrix}

\begin{frame}{Use it!}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Enable labs and show hidden events and try out the other upcoming
            features.

        \item You can run your own homeserver. Synapse is the most featureful
            server, and is relatively easy to set up.

            You can register a domain name for free for a year with the GitHub
            Student Pack.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Get involved right here at Mines}
    You can get involved in Matrix right here at ACM!

    \begin{itemize}
        \item You can join the ACM chat!
        \item If you are interested in building non-chat applications on top of
            Matrix, consider joining Visplay.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Follow the news}
    The Matrix community is very open. Most of the development happens in the
    open, and you can join development and support chat rooms.

    Here are a few to get you started:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Matrix News: \texttt{\#matrix-news:matrix.org}
        \item This Week in Matrix (TWIM): \texttt{\#twim:matrix.org}
        \item Matrix Community Space: \texttt{\#community:matrix.org} (and
            subspaces)
    \end{itemize}

    Most Matrix projects also have their own chat room.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Contribute documentation or code}
    There are many projects which need more documentation or code. The Matrix
    Community space and its subspaces are a good place to find projects.
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item There are many existing projects that you can contribute to in the
            Matrix ecosystem: Element client codebases, Synapse, Dendrite, a
            bunch of bots and bridges.
        \item You can even contribute to the Matrix spec itself via MSCs.
        \item Write a new bridge (Beeper may even pay you to do that, contact
            Eric \texttt{@eric:beeper.com})
        \item Write bots
        \item Consider joining Beeper! Contact Eric (\texttt{@eric:beeper.com})
            if you are interested.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{A few general tips for everyone}

\begin{frame}{Do something}
    Don't be paralysed because you don't know what you want to do. \textbf{Just
    do something.}

    If you don't know what interests you, try things until you find something
    that you are sufficiently motivated by.

    If you don't like what you are doing, you can always get a different job.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Getting into open source}
    If you want to become and open source developer, start by being a good open
    source project user.
    \pause

    Then start reporting issues and submitting documentation fixes.
    \pause

    Then maybe you can even start answering questions that people ask on chat
    rooms or GitHub issues associated with the project.
    \pause

    Then make small code fixes.
    \pause

    Anyone can contribute to open source, you just have to have realistic
    expectations about what that means.
